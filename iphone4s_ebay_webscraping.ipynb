I have always used Macs, so I sort of understand their way of designing things. At 65 years old, I have left it a bit late to be of any use in most reviews on these products, but this could be to someone like me, buying an old model.The worst thing about these 4s is the battery life. You can actually watch the power drain when using them, 45%...40%...35%... and I was so shocked that I had to go to the net to see if this was normal or not. It is, but I am told the later models (6s) are not so bad. I am not so sure you could watch an hour's worth of video on it without draining it completely, and sometimes it refuses to take a charge.

It now charges but only when it is turned off.I would not recommend buying one of the refurbished phones as the warranty only covers the battery for 3 months. You are also only able to get the phone repaired through universal gadgets as part of their warranty which means being without a phone for up to 7 days.Read full review...\",\n",

       " 'The Apple iPhone 4S that I bought is not proper working condition.The mobile shut downs automatically very often',\n",
       " 'The good: Apple\\'s iPhone 4S has a faster processor and an upgraded camera, all the benefits of iOS 5, and a useful and immensely fun voice assistant. Call quality on the Sprint model is admirable, andthe data speeds, while certainly not 4G, get the job done.The bad: It\\'s about time we get a larger screen.The bottom line: The iPhone 4S isn\\'t the king of cell phones, but it\\'s part of the royal family nonetheless. Even without 4G and a giant screen, this phone\\'s smart(ass) voice assistant, Siri, the benefits of iOS 5, and its spectacular camera make it a top choice for anyone ready to upgradeFor the first time since the iPhone was born four years ago, a new model didn\\'t arrive in June this year. The wait set the iPhone 5 rumor mill frothing to overflow, so when the iPhone 4S arrived as an incremental upgrade, fanboys commenced an Internet-wide rending of garments. Some critics grumbled that they didn\\'t get more, and I sympathize...kind of. Yes, the lack of 4G is disappointing. And yes, a totally new design would have been fun. But this is hardly the first time that Apple has chosen to make a subtle upgrade. Remember the iPhone 3GS?The truth is that the 4S brings healthy improvements to an already excellent device. iPhone owners finally get a 64GB model and a better camera, the dual-core processor delivers more speed, and Siri, the iPhone 4S\\' personal assistant/robot friend/gofer, adds a new and sassy experience. iOS 5 also trots out changes big and small, and we\\'re glad to see Sprint join the Apple family with a true world phone. So while the iPhone 4S isn\\'t the Jesus phone, it\\'s quite enough for plenty of other people-- more than a million, actually.Not everything impressed me. I\\'d prefer a slightly larger screen and my list of iPhones misses remains hefty. Performance on the Sprint model is satisfactory. We encountered slower 3G data speeds than on the Verizon phone, but Sprint has a slight edge in call quality. Remember that there will be a discernible difference between the 4S versions (just like we found with the AT&T and Verizon iPhone 4S) so it\\'s important to choose your carrier wisely.In the end, the decision to buy an iPhone 4S will depend on your current carrier contract. If you aren\\'t eligible for an upgrade with a rebate, I don\\'t think the new features are worth paying full price (at least $500). But if you can upgrade with a discount, or if you\\'re a Sprint customer waiting to get your hands on the iPhone for the very first time, there is enough here to warrant a switch. Sure, there\\'s the chance that a better \"iPhone 5\" will come next June, but that\\'s a long time to wait. Besides, in the cell phone world, something better is always around the corner.DesignAs I said, the iPhone 4S is indistinguishable from its predecessor. For the most part, that\\'s fine with me. Having lived through the thin phone craze started by the Motorola Razr, I\\'m not aching for a slimmer device. Granted, the 4S can feel bulky at times, but I continue to enjoy its solid feel in the hand (something that\\'s not always there with skinny phones). I don\\'t have any problems with the handset\\'s general aesthetics, either. A thinner phone may be prettier, but it\\'s what\\'s inside that really counts.Thanks again Apple my be this time next year we will get the IPHONE 5 !Read full review...',\n",
       " \"When I decided to upgrade my normal standard mobile phone, I decided to go with a touch screen as this is the way the world is going.I was worried that I wouldn't be able to use the screen well as I have used friends mobile phones with touch screens, the sensitivity was awful on them, The iphone sensitivity is great and you only have to touch what you want once.Its a great size and not over heavy (could be abit lighter though) I've placed a screen protector over the screen.... I think these are a nightmare to get on, the general part of getting them on is easy, its the removal of the air bubbles that is a pain!The iphone has everything you would ever need from a mobile and much more. Calls, Texts, Emails, Internet, Music player and great downloadable apps that are free ( you can buy premium apps as well).It is very easy to use, set up and get to know, the graphics and sounds on this are amazing.The only down side i can find on this phone is that the battery life really sucks and goes flat really easy, Since having the iphone ive had to charge the battery every single night and sometimes sooner if ive been playing on apps for a while. I have found other iphone users also have this problem as well.I would defo recommended this as a phone to have unless you need a phone with great battery life, I was worried spending so much money on this phone but I can now happily say its worth it.Read full review...\",\n",

Sad, I know, but this is true love!I fought against getting an iPhone for so long and then I treated myself to a 3G last Christmas. I've been saving for the 4S ever since!I've had this phone for about a month now and the only bad thing I can say about it is the battery life, or lack of it. I have to carry the plug and lead around in my handbag because it just will not last a whole day without a top up charge.I'm pretty sure I'm not taking full advantage of its many features, but we're still getting to know each other. Aside from using it as an actual phone (it's easy to forget that that's what it is), my main uses are music and books, with a couple of games thrown in.Between my mobile network and my broadband provider, I get free WiFi almost everywhere I go, so it's handy for Tweeting and searching the web on the go. The camera is also pretty good and I use it quite frequently.This is the only smartphone I've ever had so I can't compare it, but I wouldn't change it for the world.Read full review...\",\n",

The main down side of this phone is the battery life which I find annoyingly short and it just about lasts a full day if I am very careful how I use it. There are a number of features you can turn off and if you Google how to do this you will shown the biggest battery user features. Otherwise I would recommend this phone.Read full review...',\n",

       " \"Overall in general a fairly decent mobile phone to own, very easy to use and plenty to do on it, along with very good facilities to send text messages and do phone calls. There are plenty of applications free of charge in the app store which is good, as a lot of them try to make life easier, and to help with day to day tasks.In terms of it's battery life, I am not very impressed. You would think that a big company (Apple) would be able to create longer lasting batteries for their products. Some days the battery can be completely dead before the end of the night, which doesn't suit me, as I like to be able to use it to text or do phone calls in the evening, which is sometimes a pain because the charger I have is tiny, so I have to be right next to a plug socket while using it on charge.One thing that concerns me about the phone is the screen, it's extremely delicate, meaning if I happened to drop the phone just once, it may crack very easily, which for me is a big worry.In terms of its value for money, I bought mine second hand, because I feel they are very over priced brand new, but second hand they are fairly good for the value of money, but it's whether or not you are prepared to take the risk of it having a few scratches or usage marks.So to sum up, without waffling on too much in this review, It's a good phone, had no problems with it up to now, it's very easy to use and has loads of good features. The battery life and the delicateness of the screen are a little bit of a problem but can be over looked. So overall I'd give it a 4 out of 5 rating.Read full review...\",\n",

I am sure that if I were to have bought a brand new one it would be worth the money. The phone itself is of a nice size and weight and I can see why the Iphone is the leading make of mobile being sold. The phone itself is a marvel of modern technology. Unfortunately the handset I bought was older than advertised as the battery life was just over 8 hours on stand by. That would require charging 3 times a day just to keep it going. That's before I even started to use it, a 13% loss after a mere 30mins of use... I can see these mobiles being a fantastic utility but certainly aren't like fine wine and don't age well.

Mine is still running iOS 7.1 and I may wait for 8.1 before I upgrade, don't really need the extra features, but I know I can move to iOS 8 if I need to and so I can run pretty well any App I want and am likely to be able to do so throughout the life of my 4S.

       "  370: 'The Apple iPhone 4S that I bought is not proper working condition.The mobile shut downs automatically very often',\n",
       "  371: 'The good: Apple\\'s iPhone 4S has a faster processor and an upgraded camera, all the benefits of iOS 5, and a useful and immensely fun voice assistant. Call quality on the Sprint model is admirable, andthe data speeds, while certainly not 4G, get the job done.The bad: It\\'s about time we get a larger screen.The bottom line: The iPhone 4S isn\\'t the king of cell phones, but it\\'s part of the royal family nonetheless. Even without 4G and a giant screen, this phone\\'s smart(ass) voice assistant, Siri, the benefits of iOS 5, and its spectacular camera make it a top choice for anyone ready to upgradeFor the first time since the iPhone was born four years ago, a new model didn\\'t arrive in June this year. The wait set the iPhone 5 rumor mill frothing to overflow, so when the iPhone 4S arrived as an incremental upgrade, fanboys commenced an Internet-wide rending of garments. Some critics grumbled that they didn\\'t get more, and I sympathize...kind of. Yes, the lack of 4G is disappointing. And yes, a totally new design would have been fun. But this is hardly the first time that Apple has chosen to make a subtle upgrade. Remember the iPhone 3GS?The truth is that the 4S brings healthy improvements to an already excellent device. iPhone owners finally get a 64GB model and a better camera, the dual-core processor delivers more speed, and Siri, the iPhone 4S\\' personal assistant/robot friend/gofer, adds a new and sassy experience. iOS 5 also trots out changes big and small, and we\\'re glad to see Sprint join the Apple family with a true world phone. So while the iPhone 4S isn\\'t the Jesus phone, it\\'s quite enough for plenty of other people-- more than a million, actually.Not everything impressed me. I\\'d prefer a slightly larger screen and my list of iPhones misses remains hefty. Performance on the Sprint model is satisfactory. We encountered slower 3G data speeds than on the Verizon phone, but Sprint has a slight edge in call quality. Remember that there will be a discernible difference between the 4S versions (just like we found with the AT&T and Verizon iPhone 4S) so it\\'s important to choose your carrier wisely.In the end, the decision to buy an iPhone 4S will depend on your current carrier contract. If you aren\\'t eligible for an upgrade with a rebate, I don\\'t think the new features are worth paying full price (at least $500). But if you can upgrade with a discount, or if you\\'re a Sprint customer waiting to get your hands on the iPhone for the very first time, there is enough here to warrant a switch. Sure, there\\'s the chance that a better \"iPhone 5\" will come next June, but that\\'s a long time to wait. Besides, in the cell phone world, something better is always around the corner.DesignAs I said, the iPhone 4S is indistinguishable from its predecessor. For the most part, that\\'s fine with me. Having lived through the thin phone craze started by the Motorola Razr, I\\'m not aching for a slimmer device. Granted, the 4S can feel bulky at times, but I continue to enjoy its solid feel in the hand (something that\\'s not always there with skinny phones). I don\\'t have any problems with the handset\\'s general aesthetics, either. A thinner phone may be prettier, but it\\'s what\\'s inside that really counts.Thanks again Apple my be this time next year we will get the IPHONE 5 !Read full review...',\n",
       "  372: \"When I decided to upgrade my normal standard mobile phone, I decided to go with a touch screen as this is the way the world is going.I was worried that I wouldn't be able to use the screen well as I have used friends mobile phones with touch screens, the sensitivity was awful on them, The iphone sensitivity is great and you only have to touch what you want once.Its a great size and not over heavy (could be abit lighter though) I've placed a screen protector over the screen.... I think these are a nightmare to get on, the general part of getting them on is easy, its the removal of the air bubbles that is a pain!The iphone has everything you would ever need from a mobile and much more. Calls, Texts, Emails, Internet, Music player and great downloadable apps that are free ( you can buy premium apps as well).It is very easy to use, set up and get to know, the graphics and sounds on this are amazing.The only down side i can find on this phone is that the battery life really sucks and goes flat really easy, Since having the iphone ive had to charge the battery every single night and sometimes sooner if ive been playing on apps for a while. I have found other iphone users also have this problem as well.I would defo recommended this as a phone to have unless you need a phone with great battery life, I was worried spending so much money on this phone but I can now happily say its worth it.Read full review...\",\n",

I have to carry the plug and lead around in my handbag because it just will not last a whole day without a top up charge.I'm pretty sure I'm not taking full advantage of its many features, but we're still getting to know each other. Aside from using it as an actual phone (it's easy to forget that that's what it is), my main uses are music and books, with a couple of games thrown in.Between my mobile network and my broadband provider, I get free WiFi almost everywhere I go, so it's handy for Tweeting and searching the web on the go.

Some days the battery can be completely dead before the end of the night, which doesn't suit me, as I like to be able to use it to text or do phone calls in the evening, which is sometimes a pain because the charger I have is tiny, so I have to be right next to a plug socket while using it on charge.One thing that concerns me about the phone is the screen, it's extremely delicate, meaning if I happened to drop the phone just once, it may crack very easily, which for me is a big worry.In terms of its value for money, I bought mine second hand, because I feel they are very over priced brand new, but second hand they are fairly good for the value of money, but it's whether or not you are prepared to take the risk of it having a few scratches or usage marks.So to sum up, without waffling on too much in this review, It's a good phone, had no problems with it up to now, it's very easy to use and has loads of good features. The battery life and the delicateness of the screen are a little bit of a problem but can be over looked. So overall I'd give it a 4 out of 5 rating.Read full review...\",\n",

I am sure that if I were to have bought a brand new one it would be worth the money. The phone itself is of a nice size and weight and I can see why the Iphone is the leading make of mobile being sold. The phone itself is a marvel of modern technology. Unfortunately the handset I bought was older than advertised as the battery life was just over 8 hours on stand by. That would require charging 3 times a day just to keep it going. That's before I even started to use it, a 13% loss after a mere 30mins of use... I can see these mobiles being a fantastic utility but certainly aren't like fine wine and don't age well.

Mine is still running iOS 7.1 and I may wait for 8.1 before I upgrade, don't really need the extra features, but I know I can move to iOS 8 if I need to and so I can run pretty well any App I want and am likely to be able to do so throughout the life of my 4S.

       "{0: \"I've avoided a smart phone because, being retired, I have no real need for one and I much prefer using the full size keyboard and large vdu of my std desk top PC. Morover, I can repair/update my PC atmoderate cost which I can't easily do on a smartphone (I'm a retired electronics design engineer).What also put me off was the thought of carrying several £100 worth of electronics but for £30 it was worth a punt.It's taken me over a week to get a replacement SIM with my phone number but now I've tried it as a phone and it works very well and is easier to use than my old Nokia.  However, even without the SIM fitted it's still useful with a wifi connection and as a navigation aid (map and compass).The battery life is not huge but more than adequate on standby. I'm just checking it as I write and it will be easily OK for 24 hours and possibly longer.  In any case batteries are available and I'm confident I can repalce it if necessary.I cansider it excellent value for moneyRead full review...\",\n",
       " 1: \"This is my first smartphone and because I am a skinflint, it is an old, unlocked model. I wanted a phone which fitted in my pocket like all the other phones, so its size is perfect for me. Because itis a 4s, it has Siri which is a really efficient voice recognition system that allows you to speak to write texts etc. I was pretty quick with ordinary keypads, but the touch-sensitive little one on the iPhone 4s slowed me right up. I tried out Siri with a text, not thinking it would work properly, but it is really good, and doesn't need to be introduced to the talker.I am still feeling my way around the world of iPhones, but I am getting used to it pretty quickly. I have always used Macs, so I sort of understand their way of designing things. At 65 years old, I have left it a bit late to be of any use in most reviews on these products, but this could be to someone like me, buying an old model.The worst thing about these 4s is the battery life. You can actually watch the power drain when using them, 45%...40%...35%... and I was so shocked that I had to go to the net to see if this was normal or not. It is, but I am told the later models (6s) are not so bad. I am not so sure you could watch an hour's worth of video on it without draining it completely, and sometimes it refuses to take a charge. I am also having difficulty syncing it with my desktop, but that could just be me.Apart from that it's a great little phone and I like it a lot.Read full review...\",\n",

I wanted a phone which fitted in my pocket like all the other phones, so its size is perfect for me. Because itis a 4s, it has Siri which is a really efficient voice recognition system that allows you to speak to write texts etc. I was pretty quick with ordinary keypads, but the touch-sensitive little one on the iPhone 4s slowed me right up. I tried out Siri with a text, not thinking it would work properly, but it is really good, and doesn't need to be introduced to the talker.I am still feeling my way around the world of iPhones, but I am getting used to it pretty quickly. I have always used Macs, so I sort of understand their way of designing things. At 65 years old, I have left it a bit late to be of any use in most reviews on these products, but this could be to someone like me, buying an old model.The worst thing about these 4s is the battery life. You can actually watch the power drain when using them, 45%...40%...35%... and I was so shocked that I had to go to the net to see if this was normal or not. It is, but I am told the later models (6s) are not so bad. I am not so sure you could watch an hour's worth of video on it without draining it completely, and sometimes it refuses to take a charge. I am also having difficulty syncing it with my desktop, but that could just be me.Apart from that it's a great little phone and I like it a lot.Read full review...\",\n",

       " 370: 'The Apple iPhone 4S that I bought is not proper working condition.The mobile shut downs automatically very often',\n",
       " 371: 'The good: Apple\\'s iPhone 4S has a faster processor and an upgraded camera, all the benefits of iOS 5, and a useful and immensely fun voice assistant. Call quality on the Sprint model is admirable, andthe data speeds, while certainly not 4G, get the job done.The bad: It\\'s about time we get a larger screen.The bottom line: The iPhone 4S isn\\'t the king of cell phones, but it\\'s part of the royal family nonetheless. Even without 4G and a giant screen, this phone\\'s smart(ass) voice assistant, Siri, the benefits of iOS 5, and its spectacular camera make it a top choice for anyone ready to upgradeFor the first time since the iPhone was born four years ago, a new model didn\\'t arrive in June this year. The wait set the iPhone 5 rumor mill frothing to overflow, so when the iPhone 4S arrived as an incremental upgrade, fanboys commenced an Internet-wide rending of garments. Some critics grumbled that they didn\\'t get more, and I sympathize...kind of. Yes, the lack of 4G is disappointing. And yes, a totally new design would have been fun. But this is hardly the first time that Apple has chosen to make a subtle upgrade. Remember the iPhone 3GS?The truth is that the 4S brings healthy improvements to an already excellent device. iPhone owners finally get a 64GB model and a better camera, the dual-core processor delivers more speed, and Siri, the iPhone 4S\\' personal assistant/robot friend/gofer, adds a new and sassy experience. iOS 5 also trots out changes big and small, and we\\'re glad to see Sprint join the Apple family with a true world phone. So while the iPhone 4S isn\\'t the Jesus phone, it\\'s quite enough for plenty of other people-- more than a million, actually.Not everything impressed me. I\\'d prefer a slightly larger screen and my list of iPhones misses remains hefty. Performance on the Sprint model is satisfactory. We encountered slower 3G data speeds than on the Verizon phone, but Sprint has a slight edge in call quality. Remember that there will be a discernible difference between the 4S versions (just like we found with the AT&T and Verizon iPhone 4S) so it\\'s important to choose your carrier wisely.In the end, the decision to buy an iPhone 4S will depend on your current carrier contract. If you aren\\'t eligible for an upgrade with a rebate, I don\\'t think the new features are worth paying full price (at least $500). But if you can upgrade with a discount, or if you\\'re a Sprint customer waiting to get your hands on the iPhone for the very first time, there is enough here to warrant a switch. Sure, there\\'s the chance that a better \"iPhone 5\" will come next June, but that\\'s a long time to wait. Besides, in the cell phone world, something better is always around the corner.DesignAs I said, the iPhone 4S is indistinguishable from its predecessor. For the most part, that\\'s fine with me. Having lived through the thin phone craze started by the Motorola Razr, I\\'m not aching for a slimmer device. Granted, the 4S can feel bulky at times, but I continue to enjoy its solid feel in the hand (something that\\'s not always there with skinny phones). I don\\'t have any problems with the handset\\'s general aesthetics, either. A thinner phone may be prettier, but it\\'s what\\'s inside that really counts.Thanks again Apple my be this time next year we will get the IPHONE 5 !Read full review...',\n",
       " 372: \"When I decided to upgrade my normal standard mobile phone, I decided to go with a touch screen as this is the way the world is going.I was worried that I wouldn't be able to use the screen well as I have used friends mobile phones with touch screens, the sensitivity was awful on them, The iphone sensitivity is great and you only have to touch what you want once.Its a great size and not over heavy (could be abit lighter though) I've placed a screen protector over the screen.... I think these are a nightmare to get on, the general part of getting them on is easy, its the removal of the air bubbles that is a pain!The iphone has everything you would ever need from a mobile and much more. Calls, Texts, Emails, Internet, Music player and great downloadable apps that are free ( you can buy premium apps as well).It is very easy to use, set up and get to know, the graphics and sounds on this are amazing.The only down side i can find on this phone is that the battery life really sucks and goes flat really easy, Since having the iphone ive had to charge the battery every single night and sometimes sooner if ive been playing on apps for a while. I have found other iphone users also have this problem as well.I would defo recommended this as a phone to have unless you need a phone with great battery life, I was worried spending so much money on this phone but I can now happily say its worth it.Read full review...\",\n",

Sad, I know, but this is true love!I fought against getting an iPhone for so long and then I treated myself to a 3G last Christmas. I've been saving for the 4S ever since!I've had this phone for about a month now and the only bad thing I can say about it is the battery life, or lack of it. I have to carry the plug and lead around in my handbag because it just will not last a whole day without a top up charge.I'm pretty sure I'm not taking full advantage of its many features, but we're still getting to know each other. Aside from using it as an actual phone (it's easy to forget that that's what it is), my main uses are music and books, with a couple of games thrown in.Between my mobile network and my broadband provider, I get free WiFi almost everywhere I go, so it's handy for Tweeting and searching the web on the go.

       " 378: \"Overall in general a fairly decent mobile phone to own, very easy to use and plenty to do on it, along with very good facilities to send text messages and do phone calls. There are plenty of applications free of charge in the app store which is good, as a lot of them try to make life easier, and to help with day to day tasks.In terms of it's battery life, I am not very impressed. You would think that a big company (Apple) would be able to create longer lasting batteries for their products. Some days the battery can be completely dead before the end of the night, which doesn't suit me, as I like to be able to use it to text or do phone calls in the evening, which is sometimes a pain because the charger I have is tiny, so I have to be right next to a plug socket while using it on charge.One thing that concerns me about the phone is the screen, it's extremely delicate, meaning if I happened to drop the phone just once, it may crack very easily, which for me is a big worry.In terms of its value for money, I bought mine second hand, because I feel they are very over priced brand new, but second hand they are fairly good for the value of money, but it's whether or not you are prepared to take the risk of it having a few scratches or usage marks.So to sum up, without waffling on too much in this review, It's a good phone, had no problems with it up to now, it's very easy to use and has loads of good features. The battery life and the delicateness of the screen are a little bit of a problem but can be over looked. So overall I'd give it a 4 out of 5 rating.Read full review...\",\n",

I am sure that if I were to have bought a brand new one it would be worth the money.

Unfortunately the handset I bought was older than advertised as the battery life was just over 8 hours on stand by. That would require charging 3 times a day just to keep it going. That's before I even started to use it, a 13% loss after a mere 30mins of use... I can see these mobiles being a fantastic utility but certainly aren't like fine wine and don't age well.

Mine is still running iOS 7.1 and I may wait for 8.1 before I upgrade, don't really need the extra features, but I know I can move to iOS 8 if I need to and so I can run pretty well any App I want and am likely to be able to do so throughout the life of my 4S.

It is still able to update from Apple, the oldest model that can I understand.I think Apple are bringing out a new model which though may a few new tricks it\\'s much the same size  as the 4s ......proving perhaps that the size was right rather than the larger 5 and 6.

The installed apps are great and with many to choose to add on from the apps store starting at just 69p, calls are clear and have no drop off. The introduction of \"Siri\" in this model makes a big difference and is extremely easy to use, battery life on standby is excellent and under heavy use still performed well, the only thing I did not like is that the battery is not replaceable.Overall I would highly recommend this phone.Read full review...',\n",

I really only had a look at a couple of others and Samsung in particular.....I was torn! I would be replacing an iphone 3gs which I loved anyway but it was only 8g and that was all but gone. A serious consideration for me though was that I am a very keen cyclist and the phone would be spending a lot of time crammed into a small back pocket. The Samsung was thinner, lighter, but considerably larger. Probably more vulnerable to damage should I fall-off. I am happy with my decision for that.Although I am not a geek and hardly use it for its enormous potential, it is fast, extremely clear screen and the apps are endless to suit all and every occasion. I protect it in a rubberised armour case when on my bike,which is a good decision given the price of this wonderful technology.The battery life is far superior to my old 3gs but still requires a daily top-up most days. It is recommended by the way to 'top-up' rather than let the battery run fully low, except for once every month or two.

There are plenty of applications free of charge in the app store which is good, as a lot of them try to make life easier, and to help with day to day tasks.In terms of it's battery life, I am not very impressed. You would think that a big company (Apple) would be able to create longer lasting batteries for their products. Some days the battery can be completely dead before the end of the night, which doesn't suit me, as I like to be able to use it to text or do phone calls in the evening, which is sometimes a pain because the charger I have is tiny, so I have to be right next to a plug socket while using it on charge.One thing that concerns me about the phone is the screen, it's extremely delicate, meaning if I happened to drop the phone just once, it may crack very easily, which for me is a big worry.In terms of its value for money, I bought mine second hand, because I feel they are very over priced brand new, but second hand they are fairly good for the value of money, but it's whether or not you are prepared to take the risk of it having a few scratches or usage marks.So to sum up, without waffling on too much in this review, It's a good phone, had no problems with it up to now, it's very easy to use and has loads of good features. The battery life and the delicateness of the screen are a little bit of a problem but can be over looked. So overall I'd give it a 4 out of 5 rating.Read full review...\",\n",

       " 'The good: Apple\\'s iPhone 4S has a faster processor and an upgraded camera, all the benefits of iOS 5, and a useful and immensely fun voice assistant. Call quality on the Sprint model is admirable, andthe data speeds, while certainly not 4G, get the job done.The bad: It\\'s about time we get a larger screen.The bottom line: The iPhone 4S isn\\'t the king of cell phones, but it\\'s part of the royal family nonetheless. Even without 4G and a giant screen, this phone\\'s smart(ass) voice assistant, Siri, the benefits of iOS 5, and its spectacular camera make it a top choice for anyone ready to upgradeFor the first time since the iPhone was born four years ago, a new model didn\\'t arrive in June this year. The wait set the iPhone 5 rumor mill frothing to overflow, so when the iPhone 4S arrived as an incremental upgrade, fanboys commenced an Internet-wide rending of garments. Some critics grumbled that they didn\\'t get more, and I sympathize...kind of. Yes, the lack of 4G is disappointing. And yes, a totally new design would have been fun. But this is hardly the first time that Apple has chosen to make a subtle upgrade. Remember the iPhone 3GS?The truth is that the 4S brings healthy improvements to an already excellent device. iPhone owners finally get a 64GB model and a better camera, the dual-core processor delivers more speed, and Siri, the iPhone 4S\\' personal assistant/robot friend/gofer, adds a new and sassy experience. iOS 5 also trots out changes big and small, and we\\'re glad to see Sprint join the Apple family with a true world phone. So while the iPhone 4S isn\\'t the Jesus phone, it\\'s quite enough for plenty of other people-- more than a million, actually.Not everything impressed me. I\\'d prefer a slightly larger screen and my list of iPhones misses remains hefty. Performance on the Sprint model is satisfactory. We encountered slower 3G data speeds than on the Verizon phone, but Sprint has a slight edge in call quality. Remember that there will be a discernible difference between the 4S versions (just like we found with the AT&T and Verizon iPhone 4S) so it\\'s important to choose your carrier wisely.In the end, the decision to buy an iPhone 4S will depend on your current carrier contract. If you aren\\'t eligible for an upgrade with a rebate, I don\\'t think the new features are worth paying full price (at least $500). But if you can upgrade with a discount, or if you\\'re a Sprint customer waiting to get your hands on the iPhone for the very first time, there is enough here to warrant a switch. Sure, there\\'s the chance that a better \"iPhone 5\" will come next June, but that\\'s a long time to wait. Besides, in the cell phone world, something better is always around the corner.DesignAs I said, the iPhone 4S is indistinguishable from its predecessor. For the most part, that\\'s fine with me. Having lived through the thin phone craze started by the Motorola Razr, I\\'m not aching for a slimmer device. Granted, the 4S can feel bulky at times, but I continue to enjoy its solid feel in the hand (something that\\'s not always there with skinny phones). I don\\'t have any problems with the handset\\'s general aesthetics, either. A thinner phone may be prettier, but it\\'s what\\'s inside that really counts.Thanks again Apple my be this time next year we will get the IPHONE 5 !Read full review...',\n",

I tried out Siri with a text, not thinking it would work properly, but it is really good, and doesn't need to be introduced to the talker.I am still feeling my way around the world of iPhones, but I am getting used to it pretty quickly. I have always used Macs, so I sort of understand their way of designing things. At 65 years old, I have left it a bit late to be of any use in most reviews on these products, but this could be to someone like me, buying an old model.The worst thing about these 4s is the battery life. You can actually watch the power drain when using them, 45%...40%...35%... and I was so shocked that I had to go to the net to see if this was normal or not. It is, but I am told the later models (6s) are not so bad. I am not so sure you could watch an hour's worth of video on it without draining it completely, and sometimes it refuses to take a charge. I am also having difficulty syncing it with my desktop, but that could just be me.Apart from that it's a great little phone and I like it a lot.Read full review...\",\n",

I think these are a nightmare to get on, the general part of getting them on is easy, its the removal of the air bubbles that is a pain!The iphone has everything you would ever need from a mobile and much more. Calls, Texts, Emails, Internet, Music player and great downloadable apps that are free ( you can buy premium apps as well).It is very easy to use, set up and get to know, the graphics and sounds on this are amazing.The only down side i can find on this phone is that the battery life really sucks and goes flat really easy, Since having the iphone ive had to charge the battery every single night and sometimes sooner if ive been playing on apps for a while.

That's before I even started to use it, a 13% loss after a mere 30mins of use... I can see these mobiles being a fantastic utility but certainly aren't like fine wine and don't age well.

       " 256: \"Although the market is becoming flooded with smartphones lately, Apple has been there from the start. I really only had a look at a couple of others and Samsung in particular.....I was torn! I would be replacing an iphone 3gs which I loved anyway but it was only 8g and that was all but gone. A serious consideration for me though was that I am a very keen cyclist and the phone would be spending a lot of time crammed into a small back pocket. The Samsung was thinner, lighter, but considerably larger. Probably more vulnerable to damage should I fall-off. I am happy with my decision for that.Although I am not a geek and hardly use it for its enormous potential, it is fast, extremely clear screen and the apps are endless to suit all and every occasion. I protect it in a rubberised armour case when on my bike,which is a good decision given the price of this wonderful technology.The battery life is far superior to my old 3gs but still requires a daily top-up most days. It is recommended by the way to 'top-up' rather than let the battery run fully low, except for once every month or two. The battery will last longer.Several of my friends now have these phones and they all love them dearly.Have fun....notes strapped to pigeons legs are definately on the way out.Read full review...\",\n",

There are plenty of applications free of charge in the app store which is good, as a lot of them try to make life easier, and to help with day to day tasks.In terms of it's battery life, I am not very impressed. You would think that a big company (Apple) would be able to create longer lasting batteries for their products. Some days the battery can be completely dead before the end of the night, which doesn't suit me, as I like to be able to use it to text or do phone calls in the evening, which is sometimes a pain because the charger I have is tiny, so I have to be right next to a plug socket while using it on charge.One thing that concerns me about the phone is the screen, it's extremely delicate, meaning if I happened to drop the phone just once, it may crack very easily, which for me is a big worry.In terms of its value for money, I bought mine second hand, because I feel they are very over priced brand new, but second hand they are fairly good for the value of money, but it's whether or not you are prepared to take the risk of it having a few scratches or usage marks.So to sum up, without waffling on too much in this review, It's a good phone, had no problems with it up to now, it's very easy to use and has loads of good features. The battery life and the delicateness of the screen are a little bit of a problem but can be over looked. So overall I'd give it a 4 out of 5 rating.Read full review...\",\n",

       " 608: 'The good: Apple\\'s iPhone 4S has a faster processor and an upgraded camera, all the benefits of iOS 5, and a useful and immensely fun voice assistant. Call quality on the Sprint model is admirable, andthe data speeds, while certainly not 4G, get the job done.The bad: It\\'s about time we get a larger screen.The bottom line: The iPhone 4S isn\\'t the king of cell phones, but it\\'s part of the royal family nonetheless. Even without 4G and a giant screen, this phone\\'s smart(ass) voice assistant, Siri, the benefits of iOS 5, and its spectacular camera make it a top choice for anyone ready to upgradeFor the first time since the iPhone was born four years ago, a new model didn\\'t arrive in June this year. The wait set the iPhone 5 rumor mill frothing to overflow, so when the iPhone 4S arrived as an incremental upgrade, fanboys commenced an Internet-wide rending of garments. Some critics grumbled that they didn\\'t get more, and I sympathize...kind of. Yes, the lack of 4G is disappointing. And yes, a totally new design would have been fun. But this is hardly the first time that Apple has chosen to make a subtle upgrade. Remember the iPhone 3GS?The truth is that the 4S brings healthy improvements to an already excellent device. iPhone owners finally get a 64GB model and a better camera, the dual-core processor delivers more speed, and Siri, the iPhone 4S\\' personal assistant/robot friend/gofer, adds a new and sassy experience. iOS 5 also trots out changes big and small, and we\\'re glad to see Sprint join the Apple family with a true world phone. So while the iPhone 4S isn\\'t the Jesus phone, it\\'s quite enough for plenty of other people-- more than a million, actually.Not everything impressed me. I\\'d prefer a slightly larger screen and my list of iPhones misses remains hefty. Performance on the Sprint model is satisfactory. We encountered slower 3G data speeds than on the Verizon phone, but Sprint has a slight edge in call quality. Remember that there will be a discernible difference between the 4S versions (just like we found with the AT&T and Verizon iPhone 4S) so it\\'s important to choose your carrier wisely.In the end, the decision to buy an iPhone 4S will depend on your current carrier contract. If you aren\\'t eligible for an upgrade with a rebate, I don\\'t think the new features are worth paying full price (at least $500). But if you can upgrade with a discount, or if you\\'re a Sprint customer waiting to get your hands on the iPhone for the very first time, there is enough here to warrant a switch. Sure, there\\'s the chance that a better \"iPhone 5\" will come next June, but that\\'s a long time to wait. Besides, in the cell phone world, something better is always around the corner.DesignAs I said, the iPhone 4S is indistinguishable from its predecessor. For the most part, that\\'s fine with me. Having lived through the thin phone craze started by the Motorola Razr, I\\'m not aching for a slimmer device. Granted, the 4S can feel bulky at times, but I continue to enjoy its solid feel in the hand (something that\\'s not always there with skinny phones). I don\\'t have any problems with the handset\\'s general aesthetics, either. A thinner phone may be prettier, but it\\'s what\\'s inside that really counts.Thanks again Apple my be this time next year we will get the IPHONE 5 !Read full review...',\n",

The installed apps are great and with many to choose to add on from the apps store starting at just 69p, calls are clear and have no drop off. The introduction of \"Siri\" in this model makes a big difference and is extremely easy to use, battery life on standby is excellent and under heavy use still performed well, the only thing I did not like is that the battery is not replaceable.Overall I would highly recommend this phone.Read full review...',\n",

Mine is still running iOS 7.1 and I may wait for 8.1 before I upgrade, don't really need the extra features, but I know I can move to iOS 8 if I need to and so I can run pretty well any App I want and am likely to be able to do so throughout the life of my 4S.

I really only had a look at a couple of others and Samsung in particular.....I was torn! I would be replacing an iphone 3gs which I loved anyway but it was only 8g and that was all but gone. A serious consideration for me though was that I am a very keen cyclist and the phone would be spending a lot of time crammed into a small back pocket. The Samsung was thinner, lighter, but considerably larger. Probably more vulnerable to damage should I fall-off. I am happy with my decision for that.Although I am not a geek and hardly use it for its enormous potential, it is fast, extremely clear screen and the apps are endless to suit all and every occasion. I protect it in a rubberised armour case when on my bike,which is a good decision given the price of this wonderful technology.The battery life is far superior to my old 3gs but still requires a daily top-up most days. It is recommended by the way to 'top-up' rather than let the battery run fully low, except for once every month or two. The battery will last longer.Several of my friends now have these phones and they all love them dearly.Have fun....notes strapped to pigeons legs are definately on the way out.Read full review...\",\n",

There are plenty of applications free of charge in the app store which is good, as a lot of them try to make life easier, and to help with day to day tasks.In terms of it's battery life, I am not very impressed. You would think that a big company (Apple) would be able to create longer lasting batteries for their products. Some days the battery can be completely dead before the end of the night, which doesn't suit me, as I like to be able to use it to text or do phone calls in the evening, which is sometimes a pain because the charger I have is tiny, so I have to be right next to a plug socket while using it on charge.One thing that concerns me about the phone is the screen, it's extremely delicate, meaning if I happened to drop the phone just once, it may crack very easily, which for me is a big worry.In terms of its value for money, I bought mine second hand, because I feel they are very over priced brand new, but second hand they are fairly good for the value of money, but it's whether or not you are prepared to take the risk of it having a few scratches or usage marks.So to sum up, without waffling on too much in this review, It's a good phone, had no problems with it up to now, it's very easy to use and has loads of good features. The battery life and the delicateness of the screen are a little bit of a problem but can be over looked. So overall I'd give it a 4 out of 5 rating.Read full review...\",\n",

It now charges but only when it is turned off.I would not recommend buying one of the refurbished phones as the warranty only covers the battery for 3 months. You are also only able to get the phone repaired through universal gadgets as part of their warranty which means being without a phone for up to 7 days.Read full review...\",\n",

I wanted a phone which fitted in my pocket like all the other phones, so its size is perfect for me. Because itis a 4s, it has Siri which is a really efficient voice recognition system that allows you to speak to write texts etc. I was pretty quick with ordinary keypads, but the touch-sensitive little one on the iPhone 4s slowed me right up. I tried out Siri with a text, not thinking it would work properly, but it is really good, and doesn't need to be introduced to the talker.I am still feeling my way around the world of iPhones, but I am getting used to it pretty quickly. I have always used Macs, so I sort of understand their way of designing things. At 65 years old, I have left it a bit late to be of any use in most reviews on these products, but this could be to someone like me, buying an old model.The worst thing about these 4s is the battery life. You can actually watch the power drain when using them, 45%...40%...35%... and I was so shocked that I had to go to the net to see if this was normal or not. It is, but I am told the later models (6s) are not so bad. I am not so sure you could watch an hour's worth of video on it without draining it completely, and sometimes it refuses to take a charge. I am also having difficulty syncing it with my desktop, but that could just be me.Apart from that it's a great little phone and I like it a lot.Read full review...\",\n",

       "  608: 'The good: Apple\\'s iPhone 4S has a faster processor and an upgraded camera, all the benefits of iOS 5, and a useful and immensely fun voice assistant. Call quality on the Sprint model is admirable, andthe data speeds, while certainly not 4G, get the job done.The bad: It\\'s about time we get a larger screen.The bottom line: The iPhone 4S isn\\'t the king of cell phones, but it\\'s part of the royal family nonetheless. Even without 4G and a giant screen, this phone\\'s smart(ass) voice assistant, Siri, the benefits of iOS 5, and its spectacular camera make it a top choice for anyone ready to upgradeFor the first time since the iPhone was born four years ago, a new model didn\\'t arrive in June this year. The wait set the iPhone 5 rumor mill frothing to overflow, so when the iPhone 4S arrived as an incremental upgrade, fanboys commenced an Internet-wide rending of garments. Some critics grumbled that they didn\\'t get more, and I sympathize...kind of. Yes, the lack of 4G is disappointing. And yes, a totally new design would have been fun. But this is hardly the first time that Apple has chosen to make a subtle upgrade. Remember the iPhone 3GS?The truth is that the 4S brings healthy improvements to an already excellent device. iPhone owners finally get a 64GB model and a better camera, the dual-core processor delivers more speed, and Siri, the iPhone 4S\\' personal assistant/robot friend/gofer, adds a new and sassy experience. iOS 5 also trots out changes big and small, and we\\'re glad to see Sprint join the Apple family with a true world phone. So while the iPhone 4S isn\\'t the Jesus phone, it\\'s quite enough for plenty of other people-- more than a million, actually.Not everything impressed me. I\\'d prefer a slightly larger screen and my list of iPhones misses remains hefty. Performance on the Sprint model is satisfactory. We encountered slower 3G data speeds than on the Verizon phone, but Sprint has a slight edge in call quality. Remember that there will be a discernible difference between the 4S versions (just like we found with the AT&T and Verizon iPhone 4S) so it\\'s important to choose your carrier wisely.In the end, the decision to buy an iPhone 4S will depend on your current carrier contract. If you aren\\'t eligible for an upgrade with a rebate, I don\\'t think the new features are worth paying full price (at least $500). But if you can upgrade with a discount, or if you\\'re a Sprint customer waiting to get your hands on the iPhone for the very first time, there is enough here to warrant a switch. Sure, there\\'s the chance that a better \"iPhone 5\" will come next June, but that\\'s a long time to wait. Besides, in the cell phone world, something better is always around the corner.DesignAs I said, the iPhone 4S is indistinguishable from its predecessor. For the most part, that\\'s fine with me. Having lived through the thin phone craze started by the Motorola Razr, I\\'m not aching for a slimmer device. Granted, the 4S can feel bulky at times, but I continue to enjoy its solid feel in the hand (something that\\'s not always there with skinny phones). I don\\'t have any problems with the handset\\'s general aesthetics, either. A thinner phone may be prettier, but it\\'s what\\'s inside that really counts.Thanks again Apple my be this time next year we will get the IPHONE 5 !Read full review...',\n",
